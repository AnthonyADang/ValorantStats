### **Insights and Reflection**
Throughout the course of working on this project, I took on the task of creating comprehensive dashboards for a PC esports game, Valorant. My objective was to design and develop these dashboards to provide 
valuable insights into player performance, agent statistics, and map choice tendencies. As I reflect upon my journey, I recognize the significance and impact of my work in the world of competitive gaming.
Professional esports teams hire teams analysts to breakdown each game to discover insights about opposing teams. At this level of competetion, every advantage makes a difference. One extra round won can swing the 
outcome of the match.

One key insight I gained from this project was the importance of analyzing individual player performance. By delving deeper into player data, I was able to identify patterns, strengths, and areas of improvement for
each player. Tracking essential performance metrics such as kill-death ratio, headshot percentage, and average damage per round allowed me to see a holistic overview of a player's gameplay prowess. This information not only 
aids in player self-assessment but also serves as a valuable resource for coaches and teams in their pursuit of enhancing individual and colelctive performance.
